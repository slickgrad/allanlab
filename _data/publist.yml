- title: "Injectable osteogenic microtissues containing MSCs conformally fill and repair critical-size defects"
  image: publist1.jpg
  description: We present a biomaterials-based strategy combining mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) with a chitosan-collagen matrix to form modular microtissues designed for delivery through a needle to conformally fill cavital defects. Implantation of microtissues into a calvarial defect in the mouse resulted in complete bridging of the cavity.

  description: We developed genipin-crosslinked gelatin microspheres designed to be preferentially degraded by inflammatory (M1) macrophages to provide better spatiotemporal control of BMP2 delivery for recalcitrant wounds.

- title: "Vascular network formation by microvascular endothelial cells in modular fibrin microtissues"
  image: publist3.jpg
  description: We investigated a modular tissue engineering approach to therapeutic revascularization using fibrin-based microtissues containing embedded human endothelial cells and human fibroblasts.  Robust sprouting from microtissues was evident, with larger vessels developing over time and FB acting as pericyte-like cells by enveloping endothelial tubes. This modular format may allow minimally invasive delivery of populations of prevascularized microtissues for therapeutic applications.
