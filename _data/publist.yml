- title: "Injectable osteogenic microtissues containing MSCs conformally fill and repair critical-size defects"
  image: publist1.jpg
  description: We present a biomaterials-based strategy combining mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) with a chitosan-collagen matrix to form modular microtissues designed for delivery through a needle to conformally fill cavital defects. Implantation of microtissues into a calvarial defect in the mouse resulted in complete bridging of the cavity.

  description: We developed genipin-crosslinked gelatin microspheres designed to be preferentially degraded by inflammatory (M1) macrophages to provide better spatiotemporal control of BMP2 delivery for recalcitrant wounds.

- title: "Vascular network formation by microvascular endothelial cells in modular fibrin microtissues"
  image: publist3.jpg
  description: We investigated a modular tissue engineering approach to therapeutic revascularization using fibrin-based microtissues containing embedded human endothelial cells and human fibroblasts.  Robust sprouting from microtissues was evident, with larger vessels developing over time and FB acting as pericyte-like cells by enveloping endothelial tubes. This modular format may allow minimally invasive delivery of populations of prevascularized microtissues for therapeutic applications.

  image: publist4.jpg
  description: Previously, we demonstrated assembly of a prototype, engineered liver tissue, formed by the fusion of hepatocyte-containing capsules. Here, we analyzed the effects of various controllable system parameters with the aim of predicting the operating limits of our modular tissue in high cell density, perfused cultures.

  description: Microtissues created from the protein fibrin and containing embedded cells can be used in modular tissue engineering approaches to create larger, hierarchical and complex tissue structures. In this paper we demonstrate an emulsification-based and the beneficial effects of surfactants in reducing microtissue aggregation.
