# Open positions

### **We are always looking for new group members with passion, talent, and grit!**

You will have the chance to work on the grand challenges of tissue fabrication, biomaterials engineering, immunomodulation, and immuno-engineering. You will be engaged in determining the essential and exciting questions, designing and executing experiments, performing assays, and making discoveries.


### Applications for PhD and Postdoc positions
If you are interested in working with us as a PhD student or Postdoctoral fellow, please send me an [email](mailto:ramta@umich.edu). Briefly, mention why you are interested in this position and attach a CV, with your graduate and undergraduate grades. No need for a separate cover letter or certificates. **Important**: please insert _"Application PhD"_ or _"Application Postdoc"_ in the subject line. If you are a Master student at the University of Kentucky looking for a Master thesis project, email me or stop by my office. Women and underrepresented minorities are encouraged to apply.

#### Mentoring Philosophy
Choosing the right graduate advisor is critical for success in graduate school. I take the role of graduate advisor very seriously. As your mentor, I will train you to become an independent research scientist. At the beginning of your grad school, I will train you in our lab techniques and experimental design. As students develop their dissertation, my emphasis will shift towards training in scientific writing and grantsmanship as they gain research independence. I will do my best to fund your research, and help cover the expenses to one scientific meeting per year.
### Undergrads / Exchange students
If you are interested in pursuing a Master degree at the University of Kentucky, see the [NSE website](https://nse.org/exchange/campus-profile/104/). We take master students or summer interns if we get exceptional applicants (this usually means very good grades and a personal recommendation).
