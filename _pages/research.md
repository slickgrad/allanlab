# Research

We are interested in understanding the roles of the immune system in neotissue formation and applying this knowledge to the development of immunomodulatory biomaterials and immunotherapies for musculoskeletal and vascular regeneration. 

To this end, we study the role of macrophages in heterotrophic ossification (HO) and in various inflammatory conditions to elucidate their regenerative potential. We also develop microengineered biomaterial systems and immunomodulatory strategies to make cellular and molecular therapies useful in treating disease and trauma. Our research span both basic and translational research areas.

<!--Questions of interest include: (i), How does the Mott state collapse upon doping and how is this related to the complex phase diagram of high-temperature superconductors? (ii), What is the strange metal phase seen in correlated electron systems? Is this an exotic long-range entangled state? What is the mechanism of dissipation in that state? (iii), Why is the transition temperature in high-temperature superconductors so high? -->

### 1) Modular strategy for tissue fabrication
As part of my independent research, I am currently investigating the inflammatory pathways associated with bone regeneration using \textit{in vitro} and mouse heterotopic ossification models. My goal is to elucidate the role of macrophages in physiological and pathological ossification scenarios and harness their potential for developing clinically relevant bone regenerative therapies. Harnessing inflammatory signals to promote endogenous cell recruitment and differentiation has a multitude of advantages over traditional regeneration approaches such as reducing the dependence on exogenous cells and growth factors. Further my approach can avoid common limitations associated with cell-based therapies including poor vascularization and immune rejections. My preliminary work shows that macrophages can be modulated to secrete osteogenic and vasculogenic cytokines and consequently promote endochondral ossification (\textbf{Fig.1B}). Currently, I am investigating the mechanisms of macrophage-mediated cell recruitment and subsequent bone formation \textit{in vivo}. My future lab will focus on developing immunotherapies for large and ischemic bone defects by understanding and harnessing the regenerative inflammatory pathways (See \textbf{Appendix A} for the detailed plan). 


#### 2) Enabling technologies for tissue vascularization
As part of my postdoctoral research, I developed a different vascularization strategy using vasculogenic fibrin microtissues for creating a network of microvessels. The fibrin microtissues are injectable and once delivered within a scaffold or a tissue they generate microvessels with lumen. These microvessels inosculate and form a vessel network resembling a terminal vascular bed (\textbf{Fig.2A}) \cite{RN2156, RN2176}. Previously, I created perfusable channels using the modular assembly that are hundreds of microns in diameter and here I formed microvessels that are less than 10 microns in diameter. 

I am currently studying the contributions of immune cells especially macrophages in vessel formation both \textit{in vitro} and \textit{in vivo} (See \textbf{Appendix A}). Macrophages play a critical role in tip cell migration and anastomosis \cite{RN2159}. My preliminary studies show enhanced endothelial sprouting in the presence of macrophages (\textbf{Fig.2B}). Further, under certain stimulatory conditions, macrophages are found to secrete vasculogenic cytokines including VEGF-A and PDGF (\textbf{Fig.2C}). Using gene and protein arrays, I have investigated and identified phenotypic states of macrophages that can be harnessed for vascularization of tissue constructs and as potential targets for tumor suppression. My future research will shed light on such immune contributions to physiological and pathological vascularization to engineer material-based therapies for vascular diseases.

## 3) Immunomodulation and immunoengineering
Macrophages and neutrophils infiltrate tissues swiftly after an injury or infection. Their invasiveness is mainly steered by their secretion of MMPs \cite{RN3039}. My recently published work showed that the material properties (\textbf{Fig.3A}) could be tuned to deliver growth factors in a spatiotemporally controlled manner by synchronizing their response with the local inflammatory milieu \cite{RN2802}. Such ‘smart’ delivery vehicles are useful for targeted delivery of drugs and growth factors for healing recalcitrant wounds and inflammation-driven ailments. These ‘smart’ delivery vehicles can titrate the drug release to synchronize with the inflammatory response resulting in optimal therapeutic efficacy. This can reduce the washout of drugs during periods of low disease activity and hence prolong their therapeutic effect. Part of my future plan is to develop a flare-responsive ‘smart’ delivery system for inflammatory arthritis and osteoarthritis (OA) (\textbf{Fig.3B}). My approach will tailor the chemistry of the microparticles to take advantage of the proteases-rich inflammatory milieu for the spatiotemporally controlled release of the loaded drugs.
